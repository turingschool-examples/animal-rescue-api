## Animal Rescue

### Set Up

Clone down this repo, install the dependencies, and start the server.  It should be running on `localhost:3001`

In a new directory, create a brand new frontend for this project using ` create-react-app`.  Make sure it is running on `localhost:3000`.

### Expectations / Rules

Build a React App that displays the animals that have been rescued!  The application will also display recent donations and a form to submit your own donation!

You will have 3 hours to build this application.

We do want to see good commit habits - atomic commits that log small, focused changesets. Don't worry about creating GitHub issues, though.

### Iteration 0

First thing we want to do is fetch some info for us to display. **Thunks are not required.**
You are going to want to grab all of the rescued animal data and populate a Redux store. You should also have `isLoading` and `hasErrored` properties in your store.

### Iteration 1

Once you've populated your redux store with your data you are going to want to display the data as a card. While we wait for our data to arrive please provide a loading message for the front-end. If there is an error fetching the data, please let the user know.

Things to display:
`img, name, species, description`

### Iteration 2

Next we want to fetch all of the donation data, populate that in the redux store, and display the data as a list as well. Your `isLoading` and `hasErrored` properties should also be reused for this functionality.

Things to display:
`name, donation`

### Iteration 3

Create a controlled form component to create a donation (look into the API documentation below to see what pieces of information are expected, and what datatypes it wants each piece to be). As a user types into the input fields, the component's state should change.

When the user clicks the `Donate!` button, the application should update the store.  The new donation should display with all of the existing donations.

### Iteration 4

When the user makes a donation, the application should make a post request to the API.  The new donation should still exist upon reloading the page.

### Iteration 5 - Testing

Your app does not need to be fully tested, but you should demostrate knowledge of how to test all of the parts of your application. You should have at least one test for each of the following:

* Api calls
* An update to state component (maybe in a form component)
* Component snapshot
* Action creator
* Reducer
* mapStateToProps
* mapDispatchToProps

### API Endpoints

| url | verb | options | sample response |
| ----|------|---------|---------------- |
| `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/rescue-animals` | GET | not needed | Array of all existing animals rescued: `[{ id: 1, name: 'Nala', species: 'Mountain Lion', description: 'Although subject to previous animal abuse...', img: 'https://www.turpentinecreek.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Nala-56782.jpg' }` |
| `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/donations` | GET | not needed | Array of all existing donations: `[{ id: 1, name: 'Travis Rollins', donation: 200 }, {id: 2, name: 'Leta Keane', donation: 400 }]` |
| `http://localhost:3001/api/v1/donations/` | POST | `{id: <Number>, name: <String>, donation: <Number>}` | New donation: `{ id: 1, name: 'Travis Rollins', donation: 200 }` |

Note: All of these endpoints will return semantic errors if something is wrong with the request.
